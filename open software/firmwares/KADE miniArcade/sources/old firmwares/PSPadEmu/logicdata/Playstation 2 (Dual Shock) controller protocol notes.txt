Playstation 2 (Dual Shock) controller protocol notes
====================================================
There are many sources for information on the basics of the
Playstation controller protocol. There is frustratingly little,
however, in the way of comprehensive documentation for the
controller's full command set.

This document is a rather loose collection of reverse-engineering
notes, documenting a larger subset of the PS2 and Dual Shock
protocols than I've seen elsewhere. The reader should already be
familiar with the basics of the Playstation controller protocol.
This document has three primary sources:

  - Publicly available documents such as Playstation.txt
  
  - Traces from a homebrew PS2 controller/memory port sniffer
  
  - Interactively experimenting with a controller connected
    to both the above port sniffer and an arbitrary packet
    generator.
	
Since the Playstation always transmits and receives simultaneously,
this document uses TX/RX notation, where "TX" is the hexidecimal
command byte being transmitted to the controller and "RX" is the
hexadecimal response byte. A "|" character is often used to separate
the header from a command's payload, but it has no electrical
significance.

General packet format
---------------------

   01/     High nybble is device type, low nybble is port number
      ff   N/A (Always FF)
	  
   42/     Command byte
      41   High nybble is device mode/status, low nybble is the
           number of 16-bit words of command-specific data.
		   
   00/     N/A (Always 0)
      5a   N/A (Always 5a. End-of-header?)
	  
   .. command-specific data ..
   (Last byte is not ACK'ed)
   
The byte 0x5A seems to be used as padding in several situations.
Besides end-of-header, it seems to be sent by the PS2 when the
controller (via the low nybble of the second response byte) indicates
it has more data to reply with, but the PS2 has no more parameter
data to send.

Device modes:
  0x4: Digital
  0x7: Dual shock
  0xF: Escape
  
Note that the command byte and the mode/length byte are transferred
simultaneously. This means that the length of the reply cannot directly
depend on the command you just sent! This is probably the reason why
all escape-mode commands are the same length: the reply length can be
calculated using only the current mode, without any need to know which
command is being replied to.

This means that the data dependencies between the command and the reply
are quite small. The controller needs to process the command byte by the
time the first command-specific reply byte is sent, and it needs to
validate each byte in the header just enough to know whether that byte
gets to be ACK'ed. There are no sub-byte data dependencies, and there is
an entire byte of slack between the command and the command-specific
data.

Packet reference:
-----------------

0x40 Initialize pressure sensor
===============================

* Only ACK'ed when the controller is in escape mode (0xF)

01/ff 40/f3 00/5a | 00/00 02/00 00/02 00/00 00/00 00/5a

This command sets up parameters for a single pressure-sensitive
button. Note that it is not required in order to use pressure
sensitive buttons, and that this command by itself will not
enable them. You still need to use command 0x4f to add them
to the controller's results packet.

Command data:
  0. Button number (0x00 - 0x0b, in the same order that
     the buttons are listed in the response packet)
  1. 0x02 (?)
  2. 0x00 (?)
  3. 0x00 (?)
  4. 0x00 (?)
  5. 0x00 (?)
  
Response data:
  0. 0x00 (?)
  1. 0x00 (?)
  2. 0x02 (?)
  3. 0x00 (?)
  4. 0x00 (?)
  5. 0x5a (Padding?)
  
0x41 Get available polling results
==================================

* Only ACK'ed when the controller is in escape mode (0xF)

01/ff 41/f3 00/5a | 5a/ff 5a/ff 5a/03 5a/00 5a/00 5a/5a

Command data:
  - None (Padded with 0x5a)
  
Response data:
  - In digital mode, returns all zeroes
  - In analog mode:
  
      0-4. Bitfield of available polling results.
           (This bitfield can be given verbatim to
            command 0x4f to enable all polling results)
			
      5. Always 0x5a (padding)
	  
0x42 Controller poll (Read buttons/axes, write actuators)
=========================================================

* Valid in escape (0xf) and non-escape modes

01/ff 42/41 00/5a | 00/ff 00/ff

Side effects:
  Exits escape mode
  
Command data:
  6 bytes of Actuator data (DualShock mode only)
  See Command 0x4d for details on actuator data.
  
Response data:
  The length of the response varies, depending on
  the controller mode. The following data bytes are
  available. The actual set of data sent during each
  poll is controlled by Command 0x4f.
  
  Digital mode:
     0. buttons (1)
     1. buttons (2)
	 
  DualShock mode: (enabled by default)
     2. right_analog_x
     3. right_analog_y
     4. left_analog_x
     5. left_analog_y
	 
  DualShock mode: (disabled by default)
     6. right_pressure
     7. left_pressure
     8. up_pressure
     9. down_pressure
     10. triangle_pressure
     11. circle_pressure
     12. cross_pressure
     13. square_pressure
     14. l1_pressure
     15. r1_pressure
     16. l2_pressure
     17. r2_pressure
	 
0x43 Controller Read and Escape
===============================

* Valid in escape (0xf) and non-escape modes

01/ff 43/41 00/5a | 01/ff 00/ff

Command data:
  0. 00 to exit escape mode, 01 to enter escape mode
  1. Always zero?
  
Response data:
  (Same as comand 0x42)
  
Hypothesis:
 
  Command 0x43 is a controller read, like command 0x42, but the first
PSX->controller byte indicates whether to put the controller into an
escape mode. In escape mode, the controller's mode is reported as 0xF
and several additional commands are available.

0x44 Set major mode (DualShock/Digital)
=======================================

* Only ACK'ed when the controller is in escape mode (0xF)

01/ff 44/f3 00/5a | 01/00 03/00 00/00 00/00 00/00 00/00

Side effects:
  - Disables pressure-sensitive buttons.
  - When DualShock mode is enabled, the Analog light goes on.
  - When DualShock mode is disabled, the Analog light goes off.
  
  WARNING: There is a watchdog timer on DualShock mode.
           If the controller doesn't see the PSX polling
           (Command 0x42) for a few seconds, it switches
           back to Digital mode.
		   
Command data:
  0. 0x01 to set DualShock mode, 0x00 to set Digital mode  
  1. 0x03 (?)
  2. 0x00 (?)
  3. 0x00 (?)
  4. 0x00 (?)
  5. 0x00 (?)
  
Response data:
  Always zero?
  
0x45 Read extended status 1
===========================

* Only ACK'ed when the controller is in escape mode (0xF)

01/ff 45/f3 00/5a | 5a/03 5a/02 5a/01 5a/02 5a/01 5a/00

Command data:
  - None (Padded with 0x5a)
  
Response data:
  - 0x03 (?) on Dual Shock controller, 0x01 (?) for Guitar Hero controller
  - 0x02 (?)
  - 0x01 if the "Analog" light is on, 0x00 if it's off.
  - 0x02 (?)
  - 0x01 (?)
  - 0x00 (?)
  
0x46 Read constant 1
====================

* Only ACK'ed when the controller is in escape mode (0xF)

01/ff 46/f3 00/5a | 00/00 5a/00 5a/01 5a/02 5a/00 5a/0a
01/ff 46/f3 00/5a | 01/00 5a/00 5a/01 5a/01 5a/01 5a/14

Command data:
  0. Offset (0 or 1)
  (Padded with 0x5A)
  
This command reads some unknown identifier or status block.
The block is 10 bytes long, and has a constant value on
every controller and operating mode I've tested:

  00 01 02 00 0a
  00 01 01 01 14
  
0x47 Read constant 2
====================

* Only ACK'ed when the controller is in escape mode (0xF)

01/ff 47/f3 00/5a | 00/00 5a/00 5a/02 5a/00 5a/01 5a/00

Command data:
  0. Offset? (always 0)
  (Padded with 0x5A)
  
This command reads some unknown identifier or status block.
The block is 5 bytes long, and has a constant value on
every controller and operating mode I've tested:

  00 02 00 01 00
  
0x4c Read constant 3
====================

* Only ACK'ed when the controller is in escape mode (0xF)

01/ff 4c/f3 00/5a | 00/00 5a/00 5a/00 5a/04 5a/00 5a/00
01/ff 4c/f3 00/5a | 01/00 5a/00 5a/00 5a/07 5a/00 5a/00

Command data:
  0. Offset (0 or 1)
  (Padded with 0x5A)
  
This command reads some unknown identifier or status block.
The block is 10 bytes long, and has a constant value on
every controller and operating mode I've tested:

  00 00 04 00 00
  00 00 07 00 10
  
0x4d Specify polling command format
===================================

* Only ACK'ed when the controller is in escape mode (0xF)

01/ff 4d/f3 00/5a | 00/00 01/01 ff/ff ff/ff ff/ff ff/ff

This command sets up a mapping between bytes in each
controller poll (Command 0x42) and the controller's actuator
channels. Each data byte in this command dictates the meaning
of the corresponding data byte in command 0x42.

For the Dual Shock controller, this command can specify
the following actuator channels:

  00: Small vibration motor, with no speed control.
      If this channel is set to 0xFF, the small motor
      turns on. Any other value turns it off.
	  
  01: Larger vibration motor, with 8-bit variable speed.
  
  ff: Disabled
  
The example packet above is typical for a Dual Shock
controller.

This command's response packet is the previous actuator
mapping. By default all channels are disabled, so when
this command is run immediately after switching into
DualShock mode it will return all 0xFF.

0x4f Specify polling result format
==================================

* Only ACK'ed when the controller is in escape mode (0xF)

01/ff 4f/f3 00/5a | ff/00 ff/00 03/00 00/00 00/00 00/5a

Command data:
  Bitfield indicating which bytes in the response packet
  should be included. This lets the host instruct the
  controller to include more or less data than it would
  by default. This command is used to enable pressure-
  sensitive buttons, and it can be used to disable any of
  the default response bytes.
  
Response data:
  0. Always 0x00
  1. Always 0x00
  2. Always 0x00
  3. Always 0x00
  4. Always 0x00
  5. Always 0x5a
